[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City) defines the open-world genre, transporting players to a neon-soaked, 1980s rendition of Miami. You step into the shoes of Tommy Vercetti, a mobster recently released from prison, as he navigates a treacherous underworld of cartels, bikers, and corrupt politicians to build his own criminal empire.
