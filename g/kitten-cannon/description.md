# Description
[Kitten Cannon](https://www.igdb.com/games/kitten-cannon--1) is a piece of internet history and one of the original viral launcher games. Created by Dan Armstrong, this simple yet brutal game challenges you to fire a kitten from a cannon as far as possible.

The landscape is filled with hazards and helpers: hit trampolines and piles of dynamite to extend your flight, but avoid the spikes and Venus flytraps that bring your run to a sudden, messy halt. It is pure, classic ragdoll chaos.

# Controls
Up / Down Arrows - Adjust cannon angle.

Spacebar - Fire (hold to set power).
