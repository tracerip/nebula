# Description
[Burrito Bison](https://www.igdb.com/games/burrito-bison) is the legendary launcher game where you play as a giant luchador who has been sucked into a candy bag while grocery shopping. Trapped in a world ruled by gummy bears, your only escape is to launch yourself from a wrestling ring and bounce your way out of Candy Land.

Smash through massive doors, squash fleeing gummies to maintain speed, and earn cash to buy crucial upgrades like rocket pants, gliders, and stronger elastics. It is a perfect cycle of launch, crash, upgrade, and repeat.

If you enjoy games with addictive progression or high speed, try [Slime Rancher](play?game=slime-rancher) or [Slope](play?game=slope).

# Controls
Space / Left Click - Launch from the ropes.
Space / Left Click (In-air) - Rocket Slam (use stored energy to hit the ground and bounce higher).
