# Description
⚠️ Experimental Build: This is the [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) version of 1.12.2. While it often provides higher framerates, it may crash on older browsers or Chromebooks. If you experience issues, please use the [Standard Version](play?game=eaglercraft-1.12.2).

[Minecraft 1.12.2](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.12.2) is a highly stable release of the iconic sandbox survival game developed by [Mojang Studios](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mojang_Studios). Known as "[The World of Color Update](https://minecraft.wiki/w/World_of_Color_Update)," this version introduced concrete blocks, glazed terracotta, parrots, the recipe book, advancements system, and illusioners.

If you prefer the classic combat mechanics before the cooldown update, you should play [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8).
