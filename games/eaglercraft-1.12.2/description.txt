Looking for better performance?
We offer an experimental [WASM Version](play?game=eaglercraft-1.12.2-wasm) of this game. It runs faster on some devices but may not be supported by all browsers.

If you prefer the classic combat mechanics before the cooldown update, you should play [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8). For a nostalgic trip back to the early automation era, check out [Minecraft 1.5.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.5.2).
