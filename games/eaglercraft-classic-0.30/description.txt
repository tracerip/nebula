# Description
⚠️ Experimental Build: This is the [WebAssembly GC (WASM GC)](https://webassembly.org) version of Classic 0.30. While it often provides higher framerates, it may crash on older browsers or Chromebooks. If you experience issues, please use a different Minecraft version like [1.5.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.5.2).

[Minecraft Classic 0.30](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Classic_0.30) is the final version of the Classic development phase, released on November 10, 2009, by [Notch (Markus Persson)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Notch). This creative-only sandbox experience allows players to build freely with unlimited blocks in a simple yet charming blocky world. Featuring 32 different block types including grass, stone, wood, glass, flowers, and sponge, players can construct anything their imagination allows. With no survival mechanics, health, mobs, or crafting, this pure building experience captures the original vision of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft).

If you want the full survival experience with mobs, crafting, and modern features, try [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8) or [Minecraft 1.12.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.12.2).
