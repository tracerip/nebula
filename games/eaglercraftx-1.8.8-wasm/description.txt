# Description
⚠️ Experimental Build: This is the [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) version of 1.8.8. While it often provides higher framerates, it may crash on older browsers or Chromebooks. If you experience issues, please use the [Standard Version](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8).

[Minecraft 1.8.8](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.8.8) is a stable release of the legendary sandbox survival game developed by [Mojang Studios](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mojang_Studios). Known as "[The Bountiful Update](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bountiful_Update)," this version introduced ocean monuments, guardians, new stone variants, banners, armor stands, and enhanced command block functionality.

If you are looking for more building blocks and the updated color palette, upgrade to [Minecraft 1.12.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.12.2). Alternatively, go back to the roots of redstone engineering in [Minecraft 1.5.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.5.2).
