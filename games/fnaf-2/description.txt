[FNaF 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/332800/Five_Nights_at_Freddys_2/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_2)) ramps up the horror in a prequel set at a new Freddy Fazbear's location. No doors this time—use a flashlight on vents, wind a music box remotely, and don a Freddy mask to fool 10 aggressive animatronics like Toy Freddy, Mangle, and the Puppet. Deeper lore, custom night challenges, and intensified scares make every shift a nightmare of paranoia and precision.
