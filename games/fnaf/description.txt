[FNaF 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/Five_Nights_at_Freddys/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_1)) is the iconic survival horror game that started it all. Play as a night security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, surviving five terrifying nights by monitoring cameras, closing doors, and managing flashlight power against haunted animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. Tense atmosphere, jump scares, and limited resources create heart-pounding gameplay with multiple difficulty levels and secrets to uncover.
