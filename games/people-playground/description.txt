# Description
[People Playground](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118200/People_Playground/) is a gruesomely fun 2D sandbox physics simulator where you unleash chaos on over 100 ragdolls with 200+ weapons, explosives, traps, gadgets, and machines. Shoot, stab, burn, freeze, crush, or invent wild contraptions to test deadly scenarios. Endless experimentation, Steam Workshop sharing, and creative destruction make it a gore-filled playground of mayhem and discovery.
