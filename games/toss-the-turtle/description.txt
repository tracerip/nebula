# Description
[Toss the Turtle](https://www.igdb.com/games/toss-the-turtle) is a classic distance launcher game that defined the golden age of Flash gaming. Use a massive cannon to fire a helpless turtle into the atmosphere, then keep him airborne by shooting him with pistols, machine guns, and rocket launchers.

Dodge obstacles, hit bouncy pads, and earn cash to purchase nuclear jetpacks and devastating artillery. It is grisly, chaotic, and endlessly satisfying.

If you enjoy ragdoll destruction and chaos, you will love [People Playground](play?game=people-playground) or the high-octane action of [Ultrakill](play?game=ultrakill).
